## Minutes

### 1. Previous minutes
See <https://github.com/AGLDWG/meeting-minutes/blob/master/plenary-2021-04-01.md>


### 2. Welcoming and introduction to new members


### 3. Ontology-based standards & documentation in the OGC


### 4. ARDC project progress

* Richard's report, presented by Nick
    * infracode Registry installation close to complete
    * notification capability about to be added
    * the project has recognised the need to repetatively run IRI validation, not just when a new IRI is created, to check for degrading IRIs
        * a future version of the [new IRI validator](https://github.com/AGLDWG/iri-mapping-validator) will be used in operations

* Nick:
    * we have two IRI lifecycles that are not yet described in the Guidelines:
        * submitted > accepted > stable > unstable > deprecated
        * submitted > accepted > invalid (3 months)
    * we propose properly modelling then and likely adding a new vocab status, "unstable" that is a sub-status of "accepted" but is likely to invalidate itself for some reason, e.g. IRI resolution failing
        * if general agreement, Nick will add to the [Reg Status](https://linked.data.gov.au/def/reg-status) vocabulary that we use for IRI status
